# MPC_controller
During my first year of master degree at Politecnico di Torino, I attended a course colled "Digital control technologies and architectures". One of the main agurments of this course was the design of a MPC controller, using MATLAB and Simulink.
So this repository contains:

    The trace of the problem "trace.jpg"
    The MATLAB script file "quiz_03.m"
    The Simulink scheme "quiz_03_simulink.slx"
    The report "Design_report.doc"
    The two functions: "polyadd" and "dioph_mtx"
