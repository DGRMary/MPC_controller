# MPC_controller
During my first year of master degree at Politecnico di Torino, I attended a course colled "Digital control technologies and architectures". One of the main agurments of this course was the design of a MPC controller, using MATLAB and Simulink.
So this repository contains:
- The trace of the problem "quiz_03.jpg"
- The MATLAB script file "quiz_03_mat.m"
- The Simulink scheme "quiz_03_simulink.slx"
- The MPC libraries
